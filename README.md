Text Analysis Assignment
Welcome to the Text Analysis Assignment! In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics using Python. The goal of this assignment is to equip you with the skills to collect text data from a website, analyze its content, and derive meaningful insights.

Overview
In this assignment, we focus on extracting various linguistic features and sentiment analysis metrics from the scraped text. The key metrics include positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, average sentence length, percentage of complex words, Fog Index, average number of words per sentence, complex word count, word count, syllables per word, personal pronouns, and average word length.

Tools and Technologies
We leverage the power of Python for web scraping and text analysis. Popular libraries such as Scrapy for web scraping and NLTK  for sentiment analysis will be employed. The assignment also encourages the use of data visualization techniques to present the findings in a clear and comprehensible manner.
